# Portable-Brain
Your second brain living inside carry-on devices. Memory based on day-to-day [smartphone] HCI observations & habits.

#### TODO:
- set up poetry dependencies
- set up core lifespan and FastAPI app dependencies
- set up communication with DroidRun App (Python SDK)

### Architecture (subject to change):
- FastAPI (Handles 2 main modes: background memory/KG updates + user request processing)
    - dependencies + lifetime management
        - session management
        - logging
    - LLM service
        - main orchestrator
            - self-evaluator (based on user response to suggested action)
                - evaluated results sent to special memory handler to update directly, or observe future user action
            - memory updates
        - monitoring agent
            - semantic filtering on top of high-potential signals given by DroidRun app
            - memory updates
        - retryable LLM client
            - primary
            - fallback
        - rate-limiter
        - prompts & pydantic validation
    - memory/db storage (each of the below data structures to be explored)
        - postgres
            - baseline (normalized)
                - events
                - interactions
            - base knowledge graph
                - edges
                - nodes
            - complex KGs
                - hypergraph
                - temporal graph
        - postgres + pgvector
            - vector embeddings
            - KG + vector embeddings
    - requests + communication w/ DroidRun Service
        - simply through Python SDK import
        - passes through monitoring agent, any notable actions are forwarded to memory handler
    - routes/API for commands by user

### Dependencies
This project uses poetry to manage dependencies. Use `poetry add <package>` to add a new dependency to the project. If your dependencies are out-of-sync, use `poetry install` to fetch the latest version defined by `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`.
